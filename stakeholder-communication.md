# Stakeholder Communication Plan

| Stakeholder     | Frequency | Channel | Purpose                     |
|-----------------|-----------|---------|-----------------------------|
| Client PM       | Weekly    | Email + Zoom | Project status and blockers |
| Internal Team   | Daily     | Slack   | Task updates and issues     |
| QA/Test Team    | Ad hoc    | Slack   | UAT coordination             |
| Executive Team  | Biweekly  | Email Summary | Milestone progress and risk alerts |

## Slack Use
Created #client-rollout and #pm-team channels. Used threads for daily standups, emoji reactions for task sign-offs, and pinned resources for team reference.
